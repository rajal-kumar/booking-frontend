This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Why Next.js for this demo?

- Familiarity: Faster ramp-up, allowing me to focus on delivering UI polish and interactivity
- Modular Architecture: Easy to organize into reusable components and isolated routes
- Tailwind CSS: Fast prototyping and clean styling with built-in responsiveness
- Built-in Routing: No need for extra router packages
- Server Components + App Router: Helps separate logic and presentation cleanly
- Seamless Deployment: Deploys to Vercel in seconds with CI/CD

## Angular vs Next.js (from my perspective)

| Feature                        | Angular                            | Next.js                           |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Learning Curve                | Steeper (especially for new devs)  | Easier to ramp up                 |
| Modularity                    | Very structured                    | Flexible but clean                 |
| Styling                       | Uses Angular-specific stylesheets | Tailwind or any CSS works great    |
| Routing                       | Explicit via config                | File-based routing (faster dev)   |
| Performance Tuning            | Built-in tools                     | Better default DX (with Vercel)   |
| Ecosystem                     | Enterprise-level                   | Startup and enterprise friendly   |

> In this case, Next.js allowed me to focus on polish and speed of delivery without battling a new framework.
